# COMP3207 - Machine Learning Technologies Coursework

## Overview

This project focuses on the detection of fake news on Twitter (MediaEval 2015 dataset) using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to distinguish between real and fake tweets based on their content. Two text vectorization techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BoW), are explored along with Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifiers for text classification.
